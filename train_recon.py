# this script is to further evaluate the point-bert embedding + MLP for reconstruction task as a sanity check

# also try with dvae instead of point-bert???

# pointbert --> MLP --> 512 latent dimension --> MLP --> original shape
# pointbert --> MLP --> 512 latent dimension --> decoder --> original shape
